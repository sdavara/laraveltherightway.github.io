## Use the Current Stable Version (5.1) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

If you are getting started with Laravel, start with the current stable release of [Laravel 5.0][laravel-release]. Laravel has added 
powerful [new features](#framework_highlights) over the last few years. Though the incremental version number difference 
between 4.0 and 4.2 is small, it represents _major_ improvements. If you are looking for a function or its usage, the 
documentation on the [laravel.com/docs][laravel-docs] website will have the answer.
